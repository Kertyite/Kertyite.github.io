**Best Paper Award** 🏆

Presented research on robust State of Health (SOH) prediction for lithium-ion batteries using the ProbSparse Informer architecture at the 2025 IEEE Global Reliability & PHM Conference in Xi'an, China.

## Abstract

This study presents a robust SOH prediction method that effectively captures long-term dependencies in battery degradation patterns using the ProbSparse Informer architecture. The approach demonstrates superior performance in handling time-series data for battery health monitoring.

## Key Contributions

- Novel application of ProbSparse Informer architecture for battery SOH prediction
- Improved accuracy in long-term battery degradation forecasting
- Efficient handling of time-series data with reduced computational complexity

## Award

This work received the **Best Paper Award** at PHM-Xi'an 2025.
